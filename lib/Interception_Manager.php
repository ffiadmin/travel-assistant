/**
 * Plugin content interception class
 *
 * This class is used to initialize the current plugin. When
 * Wordpress processes each page, this class will listen for any
 * requests structured like this:
 *
 *    http://<wordpress-site>/<plugin-name>/...
 *
 * and will include the appropraite file from within the 
 * wp-includes/plugins/<plugin-name>/app folder to replace the 
 * content of the page.
 *
 * Much of this plugin will involve rewriting the content of 404
 * error pages into an application page, assuming the application
 * has a page which matches the URL.
 *
 * This class also has the ability to highlight specified link on 
 * the main navigation bar, which can be useful for highlighting 
 * active links for the plugin when Wordpress is unable to. This
 * feature works only with themese designed by ForwardFour
 * Innovations.
 * 
 * This class will also listen for any specially crafted URLs as
 * defined by the paramters given to the addException() method and will
 * use that information to handle special cases where SEO-friendly
 * URLs are requested and must be rewritten to the actual page which
 * will process the request, much like a PHP-version of mod_rewrite.

/**
 * This method is like a PHP implementation of mod_rewrite for 
 * Wordpress plugins.
 *
 * Using this function will interrupt the normal fetch-execute cycle
 * this class goes through when intercepting a page. If a special case
 * of a URL is encountered, this method will force this class to heed
 * an exception (not to be confused with throwing an exception) for that
 * URL which is defined by the parameters of this method. If said page 
 * is visited without being registered as an exception, a 404 error is
 * likely to occur.
 *
 * Here is how this method is can be called and what goes on. Let us 
 * assume that visiting a page like this: http://<wordpress-site>/
 * <plugin-name>/<page>/ would cause this class to bring the user to the
 * desired page without having to register an exception. On the contrary,
 * assume this page: http://<wordpress-site>/<plugin-name>/<page>/options/
 * is an SEO-friendly URL which would normally be handled by mod_rewrite
 * to direct the request to the appropriate page for processing. A URL
 * such as the previous one would be a case where using registerException()
 * would be necessary.
 *
 * This method takes an arbirtary number of parameters:
 *  - parameter 1: the string the URL should START with in order to 
 *                 activate the exception, with respect to the "app" 
 *                 folder. (i.e. the URL without "http://<wordpress-site>/
 *                 <plugin-name>/", note the trailing "/")
 *  - parameter 2: the URL of the file this class should request when 
 *                 this exception is encountered, with respect to the 
 *                 "app" folder
 *  - parameter n: this method will explode the URL from the name of the 
 *                 plugin to the end of the URL into an array using the
 *                 "/" as the delimiter. Using the earlier example
 *                 http://<wordpress-site>/<plugin-name>/<page>/options/
 *                 would be split into: Array([0] => <plugin-name>, [1] =>
 *                 <page>, [2] => options). Thus, each of these n parameters
 *                 would correspond to the index elements of this array for 
 *                 which this method should store for later use. For example
 *                 passing parameters 1 and 2 would store "<page>" and 
 *                 "options", respectively, for later use.
 *
 * The extracted array elements are then again stored as an array and passed
 * to the Essentials class. The page which is fetched from parameter 2 will
 * then be able to access the extracted information using $essentials->params.
 * For example, using the case presented in the comments for parameter n,
 * $essentials->params[0] would fetch "<page>" and $essentials->params[1] would
 * fetch "options".
 * 
 * @access public
 * @param  string   $activateURL The string the URL should START with in order to activate the exception, with respect to the "app" folder
 * @param  string   $redirectURL The URL of the file this class should request when this exception is encountered, with respect to the "app" folder
 * @param  int      ...$indexes  The index elements of the array holding the exploded page URL for which this method should store for later use
 * @return void
