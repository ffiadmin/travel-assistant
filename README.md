Grove City College Student Government Association Travel Assistant
===

The Travel Assistant provides a unique and creative way of being able to ask for a carpool ride or post the availability of a carpool. This application is designed to make this process as simple as possible by allowing the user to consider all of the possible needs and considerations which may arise during her trip. Finding a carpool is as simple as navigating to a destination state, then a destination city, and observing what carpools are available. The Travel Assistant also can provide a simple set of printable driving directions from an origin city to a destination city.
